Gameplay

        You play as a house cat suddenly thrown out of his home. Stranded in an alley all alone, he must now fight his way through a hoard of cat-haters or die. 

        You meet three more cats in the next level. You can control each of these cats and switch between them.

        Each cat has a set of special abilities

            You
                Dash
                Shoot single bullets
            Sneaky
                Become invisible
                Sneak kill when invisible and near an enemy
                Shoot single bullets
            Support
